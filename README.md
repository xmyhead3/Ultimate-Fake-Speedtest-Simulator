# Ultimate-Fake-Speedtest-Simulator

"Because 1Gbps is for mortals. We deal in Petabits." 🌌

Ever wanted to make your friends think you’ve tapped into a secret NASA satellite? Or maybe you want to flex a connection so fast it downloads the internet before you even click "Save"? You’re in the right place.

This is a high-fidelity speed and download simulator for the **Fish Shell**. It doesn't just show numbers; it simulates real-time traffic, fiber-optic multiplexing, and planetary-scale bandwidth.

| Level | Speed | Vibe | Danger Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Giga-Peasant** | 1 Gbps | "It's okay, I guess." | 🥱 Sleepy |
| **Terabit Titan** | 100 Tbps | Downloading Netflix in 0.5s. | 🔥 Spicy |
| **Petabit Overlord** | 1,000 Tbps | You are the Internet now. | 💀 Terminal Glows |

# 🪟 How to Flex on Windows (EZ Mode)
Windows doesn't know what a "Fish" is, so we have to teach it.

1. **Give your PC a Linux Brain 🧠:** Open PowerShell and paste: `wsl --install`. Then **Restart your computer.**
2. **Install the Fish 🐟:** Open the new Ubuntu window and type: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install fish -y
   
3. Enter the Cool Zone: Type fish to start the shell.

4. Launch: Copy the code from one of the .fish files in this repo, paste it into the window, and type speedtest.

# 🛠️ PRO PRANK TIPS
Realism Hack: Change the ISP name in the script to your local provider (Starlink, Comcast, Hormuud, AT&T, etc.).

The "Wait, What?" Effect: Run the 1Pbps plan and walk away. When your friends see Sent: 45,000 GB after 10 seconds, watch their brains melt. 🧠💥

Full Immersion: Hit F11 for Full Screen Mode. It looks 100% official.

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR DUMMIES:
This is a simulation. If you call your internet company to ask why you aren't getting these speeds, they will laugh at you.

You're a hacker now. Welcome to the Matrix. 🕶️
