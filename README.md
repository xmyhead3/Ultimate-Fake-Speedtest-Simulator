# Ultimate-Fake-Speedtest-Simulator
"Because 1Gbps is for mortals. We deal in Petabits." 🌌
Ever wanted to make your friends think you’ve tapped into a secret NASA satellite? Or maybe you want to flex a connection so fast it downloads the internet before you even click "Save"? You’re in the right place.
This is a high-fidelity speed and download simulator for the Fish Shell. It doesn't just show numbers; it simulates real-time traffic, fiber-optic multiplexing, and planetary-scale bandwidth.


# Level,Speed,Vibe,Danger Level
( Giga-Peasant,1 Gbps,"""It's okay, I guess.""",🥱 Sleepy )
( Terabit Titan,100 Tbps,Downloading Netflix in 0.5s.,🔥 Spicy )
( Petabit Overlord,"1,000 Tbps",You are the Internet now.,💀 Terminal Glows )


# 🕹️ HOW TO FLEX (Installation)
Step 1: Grab the code for your desired plan from the folders.

Step 2: Open your terminal and hit Ctrl + J (if you're in VS Code) like you're launching a nuke.

Step 3: Inject the speed into your shell: source Test_Plans.fish

Step 4: ENGAGE. 🚀

Type speedtest for the full visual experience.

Type download_test to watch the gigabytes fly.


# 🛠️ PRO PRANK TIPS (The "Cool" Section)
Realism Hack: Change the ISP name in the script to your local provider (e.g., Starlink, Comcast, Hormuud, AT&T, Spectrum (Charter), Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, BT Group (including EE and Plusnet), and Sky).

The "Wait, What?" Effect: Run the 1Pbps plan and walk away. When your friends see Sent: 45,000 GB after 10 seconds, watch their brains melt. 🧠💥

Full Immersion: Put your terminal in Full Screen Mode (F11) and turn off the menu bars. It looks 100% official.

This is a simulator. It does not actually make your internet faster. If you try to use this to download a car, it won't work. Probably.
