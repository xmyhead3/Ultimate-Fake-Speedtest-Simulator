"Because 1Gbps is for mortals. We deal in Petabits." 🌌
Ever wanted to make your friends think you’ve tapped into a secret NASA satellite? Or maybe you want to flex a connection so fast it downloads the internet before you even click "Save"? You’re in the right place.
This is a high-fidelity speed and download simulator for the Fish Shell. It doesn't just show numbers; it simulates real-time traffic, fiber-optic multiplexing, and planetary-scale bandwidth.


# | Level | Speed | Vibe | Danger Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Giga-Peasant** | 1 Gbps | "It's okay, I guess." | 🥱 Sleepy |
| **Terabit Titan** | 100 Tbps | Downloading Netflix in 0.5s. | 🔥 Spicy |
| **Petabit Overlord** | 1,000 Tbps | You are the Internet now. | 💀 Terminal Glows |


# 🕹️ HOW TO FLEX (Installation) ( Linux Users / VS Code Users )
Step 1: Grab the code for your desired plan from the folders.

Step 2: Open your terminal Fish On Linux And Paste The Code and On Visual Code Tap The `Test_Plans.fish` and hit Ctrl + J (if you're in VS Code) like you're launching a nuke.

Step 3: Inject the speed into your shell and paste it all in the terminal

Step 4: Type `speedtest` for functions speedtest and the full visual experience. 
        Type `download_test` For Function download_test to watch the gigabytes fly.

Step 5: For Visual Studio After U Paste One Of The Plans Code In The CODE BLOCKS for Test_Plans.fish Type In The Terminal `source Test_Plans.fish`

Step 4: ENGAGE. 🚀

Type `speedtest` for the full visual experience. ( The Function Name Must Match The `speedtest` Make Sure It Is Not `download_test`)

Type `download_test` to watch the gigabytes fly. ( The Function Name Must Match The `download_test` Make Sure It Is Not `speedtest`)

# 🪟 How to Flex on Windows (The "EZ Mode" Guide)
Is your Windows feeling slow and boring? Let's give it some "Main Character Energy." Since Windows doesn't know what a "Fish" is, we have to teach it. Follow these steps (don't worry, I'll hold your hand):

Step 1: Give your PC a Linux Brain 🧠
Windows is okay, but Linux is where the speed lives.

Click your Start Button and type PowerShell.

Open it and paste this magic spell: `wsl --install`
Restart your computer. (Yes, actually do it. Don't be lazy!)

Step 2: Install the Fish (No Water Required 🐟)
Once your computer wakes up, a black box (Ubuntu) will pop up.

Inside that box, type this and hit Enter: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install fish -y`
Now, just type fish to enter the cool zone.

Step 3: Launch the Download Test Files Or Speedtest Files Prank And CHoose Any plans to Copy The Codes That Inside The `.fish` files! 🚀
Now that you have the Fish SHELL READY Paste The Code Inside FISH SHELL

Step 4: Type `speedtest` for the full visual experience and watch your friends' jaws hit the floor. 😲💥. ( The Function Name Must Match The `speedtest` Make Sure It Is Not `download_test`)

  Type `download_test` to watch the gigabytes fly also in ways you never seen before. ( The Function Name Must Match The `download_test` Make Sure It Is Not `speedtest`)

# 🛠️ PRO PRANK TIPS (The "Cool" Section)
Realism Hack: Change the ISP name in the script to your local provider (e.g., Starlink, Comcast, Hormuud, AT&T, Spectrum (Charter), Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, BT Group (including EE and Plusnet), and Sky).

The "Wait, What?" Effect: Run the 1Pbps plan and walk away. When your friends see Sent: 45,000 GB after 10 seconds, watch their brains melt. 🧠💥

Full Immersion: Put your terminal in Full Screen Mode (F11) and turn off the menu bars. It looks 100% official.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR DUMMIES:
This is a simulation. If you call your internet company to ask why you aren't getting these speeds for real, they will laugh at you.

The "Black Box" is your friend. Don't be scared of the text; you're basically a hacker now. Welcome to the Matrix. 🕶️

 ## 📜 DISCLAIMER ##
This is a simulator. It does not actually make your internet faster. If you try to use this to download a car, it won't work. Probably.
